% function for changing settings on a WPI Aladdin Syringe Pump

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If the current address is unknown press and hold the diameter key on the
% pump to access the pump setup and look for Ad:NN in this the NN will be the current pump address 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input:
% s_connect - this is the current connection to the syringe pump Eg: pump 
% state - this is start or stop depending on what you want the pump to do should either be 'start' to start pump or 'stop' to stop pump 
% address (optional) the address will automatically be 00 if it is any other input should be 01 or NN where N is the number between 1-99

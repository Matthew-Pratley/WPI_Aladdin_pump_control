function [s_connect] = wpi_set_diam_v1(s_connect, value, address)
% function for changing settings on a WPI Aladdin Syringe Pump

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If the current address is unknown press and hold the diameter key on the
% pump to access the pump setup and look for Ad:NN in this the NN will be the current pump address 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input:
% s_connect - this is the current connection to the syringe pump Eg: pump 
% value - the numerical value you wish to set that setting to Eg: 40
% ******** Value can also be used to read the set diameter using 'read' as an input **********
% address (optional) the address will automatically be 00 if it is any other input should be '01' or 'NN' where N is the number between 1-99 
%
% Output:
% text confirmation of the change in address of the pump in the command line

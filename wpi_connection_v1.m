% function for connecting to a WPI Aladdin Syringe Pump

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If the current address is unknown press and hold the diameter key on the
% pump to access the pump setup and look for Ad:NN in this the NN will be the current pump address 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input:
% ports - this is the comport you want to connect to Eg: 'COM3'
% address - this is the address of the pump, automatically set to 00 but can be changed  
%
% Output:
% s_connect - the connection to the serial port

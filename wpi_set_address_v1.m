function [s_connect] = wpi_set_address_v1(s_connect, curr_add, new_add);
% function for changing the address of a WPI Aladdin Syringe Pump

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If the current address is unknown press and hold the diameter key on the
% pump to access the pump setup and look for Ad:NN in this the NN will be the current pump address 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input:
% s_connect - this is the current connection to the syringe pump Eg: pump 
% curr_add - this is the current address of the pump if not used previously
% the address should be 00 Eg: '00' or 'NN' where N is the number between 1-99 
% new_add - this is the new address that the pump will be at Eg: '00' or 'NN' where N is the number between 1-99 
%
%
% Output:
% text confirmation of the change in address of the pump in the command line
